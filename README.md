This project is a webapp that displays the simulation results of the MADMAX experiment.

To start the application, execute the file “start.jl”. To do this, navigate to the file path of the unpacked download folder in your Julia Terminal and execute the command include(“start.jl”). The web interface is now hosted locally on your computer and you can call up the website in the browser under “http://127.0.0.1:8000/”.
