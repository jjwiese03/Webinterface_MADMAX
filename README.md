## Project description 

This simulation tool was developed as part of a bachelor’s thesis at RWTH Aachen University ([link](https://www.institut3a.physik.rwth-aachen.de/global/show_document.asp?id=aaaaaaaaddzwdlm)). It is designed as a web application, as the goal is to make it accessible online in the future. The purpose of the tool is to visualize key properties of the MADMAX experiment as a function of the experimental settings.

## Quick start

To start the application, execute the file “start.jl”. To do this, navigate to the file path of the unpacked download folder in your Julia Terminal and execute the command include(“start.jl”). The web interface is now hosted locally on your computer and you can call up the website in the browser under “http://127.0.0.1:8000/”.

## Status

The tool can be launched locally on personal computers and has so far been running smoothly and without errors.
